# Genetic Algorithm

A search algorithm, works like the evolution of creatures.

* Abstract the problem, to represent the solution with encoded data (vectors, matrics, etc.)
* Initialize a set of samples randomly.
* Evaluate all the samples, and keep the best samples.
* Remove the other samples, and generate new samples from the best ones, with randomization.
* Repeat 3-4, until reached target.
